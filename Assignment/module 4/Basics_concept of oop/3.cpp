what is difference between oop and pop
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)


OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It's based on the idea of creating objects that have properties and methods that describe and define their behavior.

Key characteristics of OOP:

Encapsulation: Objects hide their internal implementation details and expose only the necessary information to the outside world.
Abstraction: Objects represent complex systems in a simplified way, exposing only the essential features.
Inheritance: Objects can inherit properties and behavior from parent objects.
Polymorphism: Objects can take on multiple forms, depending on the context.




POP (Procedure-Oriented Programming)

POP, also known as procedural programming, is a paradigm that focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. It's based on the concept of a program being a collection of procedures that are executed in a specific order.

Key characteristics of POP:

Procedures: Self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task.
Functions: Blocks of code that take input, perform a task, and return output.
Top-down approach: Programs are designed by breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
