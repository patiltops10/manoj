//What is OOP? List OOP concepts
Object Oriented Programming:
Before starting to learn C++ it is essential to have a basic knowledge of the concepts of Object 
oriented programming. Some of the important object oriented features are namely:
 Objects 
 Classes 
 Inheritance 
 Data Abstraction 
 Data Encapsulation 
 Polymorphism 
 Overloading 
 Reusability 

Objects: 
Object is the basic unit of object-oriented programming. Objects are identified by its unique name. 
An object represents a particular instance of a class. There can be more than one instance of a class. 
Each instance of a class can hold its own relevant data. 
An Object is a collection of data members and associated member functions also known as methods. 

Classes: 
Classes are data types based on which objects are created. Objects with similar properties and 
methods are grouped together to form a Class. Thus a Class represents a set of individual objects. 
Characteristics of an object are represented in a class as Properties. The actions that can be 
performed by objects become functions of the class and are referred to as Methods.

Inheritance:
Inheritance is the process of forming a new class from an existing class or base class. The base class 
is also known as parent class or super class. The new class that is formed is called derived class. 
Derived class is also known as a child class or sub class. Inheritance helps in reducing the overall code 
size of the program, which is an important concept in object-oriented programming. 

 
Data Abstraction: 
Data Abstraction increases the power of programming language by creating user defined data types. 
Data Abstraction also represents the needed information in the program without presenting the 
details. 

Data Encapsulation: 
Data Encapsulation combines data and functions into a single unit called Class. When using Data 
Encapsulation, data is not accessed directly; it is only accessible through the functions present inside 
the class. Data Encapsulation enables the important concept of data hiding possible.

Polymorphism: 
Polymorphism allows routines to use variables of different types at different times. An operator or 
function can be given different meanings or functions. Polymorphism refers to a single function or 
multi-functioning operator performing in different ways.

Overloading:
Overloading is one type of Polymorphism. It allows an object to have different meanings, depending 
on its context. When an existing operator or function begins to operate on new data type, or class, it 
is understood to be overloaded. 

Reusability: 
This term refers to the ability for multiple programmers to use the same written and debugged 
existing class of data. This is a time saving device and adds code efficiency to the language. 
Additionally, the programmer can incorporate new features to the existing class, further developing 
the application and allowing users to achieve increased performance. This time saving feature 
optimizes code, helps in gaining secured applications and facilitates easier maintenance on the 
application. 
The implementation of each of the above object-oriented programming features for C++ will be 
highlighted in later sections.
